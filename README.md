# git_automation

A simple bash script that makes checkin git to remote branch little bit faster. 

Was annoyed switching between repos to keep track of changes so thought about automating this flow and created this. Still rudimentary but does my work done. Need to make some changes to fetch git locations dynamically

Future Improvements:
1. Dynamically Fetch locations of git repos from menu
2. Create a branch
3. Initiate a new local repo
